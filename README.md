# BilStudy

BilStudy is a studying app combining three different utilities and methods used by students
to effectively study.

## Description
The app is made of 4 sections:
### The Leitner Section
A studying method in which example questions are categorized based on how
good the user is at solving them. The more they get a question right,
the less frequently they have to solve them. The opposite is also true.
Boxes contain questions, and folders contain boxes. Every question is solved
daily, thridaily or weekly.

### The Notepad Section
Users can take notes here in three different templates: Text, Mindmap and To-Do List.

### The Pomodoro Section
Users can use preset intervals to set timers while studying. The app comes with 4 presets:
Classic Pomodoro: 25 minutes study time, 5 minutes break
Extreme Pomodoro: 60 minutes study time, 20 minutes break
Extended Pomodoro: 40 minutes study time, 10 minutes break
Bilkent Student: 120 minutes study time, 30 minutes break

### The Profile
Users can view their search history from here. They can also use the coins
they gain from studying to decorate their study room. There is also a calender
that is synchronized with the To-Do List notes that can hold events.

## Installation

Currently the app is not distributed anywhere, so you will have to clone the project,
import it in Android Studio and build it yourself.
